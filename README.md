# Risk-Management

## Math GR 5320 Financial Risk Management and Regulation(Fall 2016)

+ Homework

Much of the homework will be computational, requiring programming. Some of the homework will require proving and deriving results.

+ Project

The project for this course is to develop a risk calculation system. The system should be able to compute Monte Carlo VaR on a portfolio of stocks and simple options. This will require substantial programming as well as extensive writing  and documentation. It is expected the programming will be completed in Python, matlab, octave, R or C++.

+ Textbooks and Resources

Course materials consist of the lectures, lecture notes and online reference materials, including code samples. References relevant to each lecture are referenced in the lecture notes. Supplementary readings will be made available as well.
Much of the quantitative material in this course also appears in one or more of the following **textbooks**:

** Quantitative Risk Management ** (Coleman [Col12], but part 1 appears to be available in Coleman [Col11]).
    + Global Risk Management: A Quantitative Guide  [Che13]
    +  Quantitative Risk Management: Concepts, Techniques and Tools [MFE15].
